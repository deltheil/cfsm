 - (djm) Flesh out C implementation some more, fix some parser and
   template bugs. Now at the point where it will generate output, but
   that output is still incomplete and buggy.

20070408
 - (djm) Extract C source and header from cfsm and factor it into templates

20070407
 - (djm) Begin reimplementation of cfsm in C, starting with a lexer/parser
   and skeleton main executable.

20070326
 - (djm) Return a meaningful error code "CFSM_ERR_*" rather than -1 for
   everything
 - (djm) RCS Ids in everything
 - (djm) Implement ignored events

20070324
 - (djm) Implement event-driven FSMs
 - (djm) Remove the ctx settor functions in favour of passing in a ctx
   to the state advance function. Quite a bit simpler and matches what most
   apps do better.

20070311
 - (djm) Parametise location of cfsm program for regression tests
 - (djm) Some cleanup ahead of parser extension: make a fsm.new_state
   static factory to create new State objects pre-bound to the fsm
   (removes some ugly code). Extend parser table a little so we can accept
   new statful keywords

20070208
 - (djm) Mutable function signatures for the transition and precondition
   callbacks. You can now specify zero or more of: current_state, new_state,
   (void *)ctx. Also add ctx settor functions that are emitted if a ctx is
   included in a callback's signature
 - (djm) Add a regress test that exercises the example.fsm file in the top
   level directory. If I ship an example, it had better work!

20070208
 - (djm) Generalised the generated code: a FSM is now an opaque structure
   rather than having only one per generated source file
 - (djm) Add a regress test for the multiple initial-state case
 - (djm) (Mostly) templatise the emitted C code
 - (djm) Add a more extensive regression test and fix the bugs it uncovered

20070207
 - (djm) Initial import of cfsm
