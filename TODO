manpage!!!

output for other languages (just a matter of templates)
	pure python
	CPython module (worth it?)
	java

improve the grammar to get rid of current_state/event crap

optionally generate callback stubs into a separate file too

explicitly numbered events / states

per-transtion function calls/preconditions

oneshot events
one-visit states

implement transition checks as a packed (bit vector) adjacency matrix
rather than a rat's nest of switch() statements
  further to this - generalise all code into a libcfsm and only generate
  starting data (have per-transition lists of function pointers)

improve graphviz output
	display preconditions
	display transition calls

more regress tests
	test parser
	test consistency checks

better documentation
	manpages
	BNF for parser

state_reset() function
	(probably don't need this)

reentrance protection?
	set a flag in the fsm struct in state_advance

"template" state/events:
    state *
      on-exit blah
    event INPUT_*_OPEN
      ...

wildcard events:
    state foo
        on-event ABC* -> blah

wildcard next states
